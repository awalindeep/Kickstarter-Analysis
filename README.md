# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

  

## Performing data analysis on Crowdfunding Campaigns to uncover trends based on Launch dates and funding goals.

  

## Overview of Project

 ### Background of Project 

#### In short length of time, Louise's play "FEVER" came close to reaching its fundraising target. She is now looking to know how certain campaigns fared in terms of their debut dates and financial targets. She is looking for help to Organize, Sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine specific factors that make projects campaign successful. 

#### We will be assisting Louise with this and performing data analysis on crowd funding projects to uncover any hidden trends and provide insights. We will be analyzing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding targets using kickstarter statistics provided earlier. These analysis will set her campaign to mirror other successful campaigns in Theater category.

  

### Purpose of Project

  
### The purpose of this project is to use accessible kickstarter data and see how different Crowdfunded campaigns performed in relation to their Launch date and financial targets. After running the Analysis generate insights that will help Louise with her Play *Fever*. 

 ## Analysis and Challenges

  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  

* After performing the analysis it was found that for parent category "Theater" the month of May launched most successful Kickstarter campaigns.

  

* January, March, September and November and December all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

  

* The theater campaign followed an overall trend: There is a spike of successful campaigns that began in May, but tapered off by the end of the year.

  

* The findings can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of [Theater Outcomes Based on Launch date line chart](https://github.com/awalindeep/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/AwalinGHMAIN/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  

* From Outcomes based on Goals analysis it can be determined that percentage Failed Kickstarter campaigns was lower for lower fundraising goals.

  

* [The outcomes based on goals line chart](https://github.com/awalindeep/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/AwalinGHMAIN/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) also dictates that the campaigns with lower fundraising goals had high success rate.

  

* In result we can conclude that the higher the fund raising goals the lower the success rate of a campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were few challenges and difficulties faced during this Challenge.

*   Locating StarterBook.xlsx
    * It was a challenge to find the StarterBook.xlsx file. It seemed like we had to use new worksheet all together but actually we were supposed to use the same file from Module 1 activity and make a copy of it and rename it. To fix this issues I had to reach out to TA on slack but was later able to figure it out by myself before TA was able to provide the answer.

* Filtering Live out of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
    * During the exercise of creating pivot table filtering out live wasn't mentioned in instruction due to which chart comparison was not the same. Had to dig deeper into instructions to find out that Live needs to be filtered out to have the exact match with challenge. Peers from class ran into same issue and posted questions on slack where I was able to answer them and assist with this.

* Deliverable 2 : Goals chart not matching
    * While performing deliverable 2 challenge I identified that my chart wasn't matching the one provided in Module challenge. After reviewing all the data sets I figured out that I missed to add a number in Goal column due to which my result was skewed. I was able to add the numbers and update the chart for exact match. Again peers in class ran into same issue and I was able to assist them on slack from my experience. 
  

## Results

  

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  

    - Based on our findings, the month of May had the most successful Kickstarter campaigns for the parent category "Theater." April, May, June, and July accounted for 44% of all successful programmes.
  

    - While 40% of failed campaigns were launched in May, June, and July The campaigns launched in January, March, September, November, and December was nearly the same

  

    -    The Theater campaign followed a general trend: there was a burst of strong trends in May, but by the end of the year, they had faded off.
  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  

    - We may conclude from Outcomes on Targets in Parent category of Theater campaigns that the greater the fund-raising goals, the lower the campaign's success rate.

  

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

     * There were few limitations of data set. One of the limitations was that it was unstructured and had to be converted from tabular data to readable data. It required reorganization to be analyze properly. There were deficiencies in data to run measurements and the format had to be converted for columns and rows. The data had to be filtered to analyze the goals and reach the desired outcomes of generating insights that will help Louise.
     
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    * We can create a Pivot table for parent category Theater to analyze the Outcome based on Country and Currency in which the campaigns were most successful and add a pivot table graphs.
